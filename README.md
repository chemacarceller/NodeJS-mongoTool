# NodeJS-mongoTool

This is the development of a Nodejs module that works on Mongoose to allow the management of primary keys and auto-incrementing fields within a collection

The demo folder contains an example of usage of this component

Also this component has been tested in https://jocarpe.itch.io/third-person-character-demo

This is a demo in continuous development to test all the components developed and in the process of future development. 

It also adds the ability to change characters and view resource consumption via a plugin. 

A detailed explanation of how the demo works is available on the itch.io page indicated. 

Feel free to check it out in either of its two versions, Windows or Linux.
